## WEEK6

In the first week of the project, my team members and I discussed the project plan. After several rounds of brainstorming, we finally decided on the project. We would like to try to create a device that combines plants with machinery.

We identified two inputs as the pressure sensor and the acoustic sensor, but the other output besides servo has not been determined. Therefore, we made an appointment for the tutorial.

## WEEK7

Before going to the tutorial, we listed all feasible solutions, which was very helpful for us to communicate with the tutor. Matt shared some ideas with us and provided us with a lot of material. After talking to Matt, we had a lot more inspiration and a lot more purpose.

I did some research online and after I got those sensors. After that, I ran separate module tests on the acoustic sensor, pressure sensor, servo and telesfit rod using the online test code. I started the circuit design, after making sure that the components were working properly.

## WEEK8

We've had a really tough week. I used wires to stitch together the designed circuit diagram, but I found that the output of the pressure sensor and the acoustic sensor was intermittent. I suspect the circuit was broken because of the wiring. Therefore, we decided to go to CCI welding, welding the wire to the strip bord can reduce the possibility of circuit breaking. 

It is worth celebrating that after welding, the indicator number of pressure sensor and acoustic sensor is very stable and the electric telescopic rod can also move well. However, I found out that I didn't control five servos. 

I suspect that the problem appears in the circuit or code of PCA9685 module, so we conducted a separate test on this module. It was a very difficult process. I used the test code provided online and found that it still didn't drive servo, so we turned to Matt and Pete for help. With the help of my teacher, I learned that the pin Settings of Arduino UNO development edition and Arduino leonardo development board are slightly different. 

After changing the pins, the servo driver can be made using the test code. That means our problem is in the code. The use of PCA9685 is a bit complicated for us. My team and I spent a day researching this module, but still failed to solve the problem that servo could not drive. Due to the time crunch, we decided to change the circuit diagram and code temporarily. 

We did not use PCA9685 module in the end, but used two Arduino leonardo to drive these modules. It's a great pity for me. I prefer to continue working on the module later, and would like to be able to implement the driver using my original proposal. I still think the module will reduce the complexity of the circuit and thus reduce more uncertainty. But the challenge I am facing now is that I am still not very familiar with physical computing, so I need to make more efforts.
