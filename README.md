## WEEK6

In the first week of the project, my team members and I discussed the project plan. After several rounds of brainstorming, we finally decided on the project. We would like to try to create a device that combines plants with machinery.

We identified two inputs as the pressure sensor and the acoustic sensor, but the other output besides servo has not been determined. Therefore, we made an appointment for the tutorial.

## WEEK7

Before going to the tutorial, we listed all feasible solutions, which was very helpful for us to communicate with the tutor. Matt shared some ideas with us and provided us with a lot of material. After talking to Matt, we had a lot more inspiration and a lot more purpose.

I did some research online and after I got those sensors. After that, I ran separate module tests on the acoustic sensor, pressure sensor, servo and telesfit rod using the online test code. I started the circuit design, after making sure that the components were working properly.

We went to purchase some materials for the exterior of the device, like tin foil and some clay. We chose these materials because tinfoil makes our installation look more technological. And we're going to make mechanical branches that are as long as octopus tentacles. Due to the influence of the center of gravity, a heavy and strong root is needed to stabilize the branch. It's been a easy week. The next two weeks were very busy.

## WEEK8

We've had a really tough week. I used wires to stitch together the designed circuit diagram, but I found that the output of the pressure sensor and the acoustic sensor was intermittent. I suspect the circuit was broken because of the wiring. Therefore, we decided to go to CCI welding, welding the wire to the strip bord can reduce the possibility of circuit breaking. 

It is worth celebrating that after welding, the indicator number of pressure sensor and acoustic sensor is very stable and the electric telescopic rod can also move well. However, I found out that I didn't control five servos. 

I suspect that the problem appears in the circuit or code of PCA9685 module, so we conducted a separate test on this module. It was a very difficult process. I used the test code provided online and found that it still didn't drive servo, so we turned to Matt and Pete for help. With the help of my teacher, I learned that the pin Settings of Arduino UNO development edition and Arduino leonardo development board are slightly different. 

After changing the pins, the servo driver can be made using the test code. That means our problem is in the code. The use of PCA9685 is a bit complicated for us. My team and I spent a day researching this module, but still failed to solve the problem that servo could not drive. Due to the time crunch, we decided to change the circuit diagram and code temporarily. 

We did not use PCA9685 module in the end, but used two Arduino leonardo to drive these modules. It's a great pity for me. I prefer to continue working on the module later, and would like to be able to implement the driver using my original proposal. I still think the module will reduce the complexity of the circuit and thus reduce more uncertainty. But the challenge I am facing now is that I am still not very familiar with physical computing, so I need to make more efforts.

## WEEK9

After the plan change in week 8, our work became much smoother. This week is also the last week to make the device. We need to integrate the circuit part with the appearance part of the device, which also requires a lot of work. And we need to test at every stage to make sure that our device is giving the right feedback.

This week's work is very complicated, and to a large extent, I need to cooperate with my team members to complete it. In addition to testing the device, we also assembled the roots, trunks, branches and flowers we designed. The process is also very tiring. Our circuit has a lot of servos to control, so the wires are very messy. I arranged the wires before placing the Arduino board in our paper planter. I think safety should also be considered, so I put electrical tape on all the POTS because we need to use a lot of tinfoil to wrap the device. We also needed to consider the placement of the circuit part. In the end, we chose to put a thick layer of foam board in the middle of the hard paper box, under which the circuit part was placed, and above which our device was placed. We also need some good supporting material to support the foam board and the roots. We chose to use the roll inside the discarded tin foil, which has good hardness and can be reused as waste. For the tree branches, we latex kitchen paper onto tinfoil and then paint it with brown paint. This makes the texture of the branches very realistic.

In the end we were very satisfied with the results of our device. In class on Friday, we brought the installation to the classroom, and our work was well received by many people.
